--- EDITOR ----
matrix

multiplayer editing

one instanced mesh per team/player (dynamic material changing - maybe we want the castle to become transparent for some weapons)


--- MECHANICS ---
fast building vs customization?
destroy if no sustain?
attacks have to be suuuuper slow


--- WEAPONS ---
Grapple catapult!

--- PERFORMANCE / PROJECT MAINTENANCE ---
Projectiles - no shadows
Projectile pooling
No big assets until it's time - fuck graphics, only gameplay. Visual stuff can be ok for prototyping but only if it's light.


--- TECH DEBT ---
Camera moves with cursor... should be much more sensitive and only active while holding a button
Make a proper pawn - hold right click to rotate camera, fake mouse cursor with adjustable sensitivity, left click to spawn - wasd movement
rename stuff - arrow (and many others)
delete useless stuff
relocate content properly
